# 00-SpiceWorks-Migration
Spiceworks 7.5.00107 to OsTicket v1.18 database migration ðŸ¦†

This migration process involves transferring ticket data, including ticket details, comments, and user information, from the Spiceworks database to the osTicket database - notably, we ignored attachments. To achieve this, import functions have been created in python based on the analysis of osTicket's SQL logs. There are probably many other ways to automate migration, this is just one method. Using this method will require customizing the code written here, but hopefully this helps cut down some of the headache of spending hours scrolling through query logs...

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites 

The migration functions use the following non-standard package: 
- [mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/): Python MySQL connector to interact with MySQL databases.

### Installing 

You can install the required packages using pip:

`pip install mysql-connector-python`



## Usage

### Customization

This migration method requires a descent amount of customization of these scripts (your custom fields will obviously be different): 
- Update MySQL database credentials in example_creds.txt and rename file db_creds.txt (note: this requires that the pc that you are connecting to the database has been granted priveleges to remote connect e.g. `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'migrator_username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`)
- Modify the **`hostname`** and **`database_name`** parameters in **`process_tickets`** function global variables to match your osTicket database configuration 
- Create an Import Agent for creating tickets and posting replies and change these values in global variables **`process_tickets`**
- In **`create_ticket`** function on first insert into ost_ticket, change value 18 to preferred imported help topic found in **`ost_help_topic table`** (**CHANGE 18 -> YOUR IMPORTED HELP TOPIC ID**)
- **REMOVE LAST 4 FIELDS IN** **`ticket_details`** **DICT AND INSERT STATEMENTS IN** **`create_ticket`** **WITH CHANGE/REMOVE OR FUNCTION WILL NOT WORK**
- If your osTicket instance has custom fields, adjust the **`ticket_details`** dictionary in the **`create_ticket`** function to include the appropriate custom fields and their corresponding values and you'll need to add your own SQL insert calls
- Save columns **`id`** and **`value`** from **`ost_list_items`** table as a dictionary {id:value}

## Get info about ticket sender `get_user`

### Inputs

- **`user`** (int) the user ID (`ticket.reported_by_id`)

### Outputs

- **`dict`** of `{str : str}`
  A dictionary of user info derived from database fields:
  - id: the user id
  - email: the user email, from `users.email`
  - name: the user name, concatenating first_name and last_name from `users.first_name` + `users_last.name` (only populated for "staff" users)
  - phone: the user phone number, concatenating `users.office_phone` and `users.cell_phone` (rarely populated)   

If the user doesn't exist, returns an empty dict.

## Get ticket content `get_ticket`

### Inputs

- **`ticket`** (int) the ticket ID (`tickets.id`)

### Outputs

- **`dict`** of `{str : str}`
    A dictionary of user info derived from database fields:
    - id (from `tickets.id`)
    - summary (from `tickets.summary`)
    - description (from `tickets.description`) Note: no cleaning/HTML-ification performed here
    - created_at (from `tickets.created_at`)
    - closed_at (from `tickets.closed_at`)
    - created_by, but by the email of that user (from `users.email where users.id = tickets.created_by`)
    - assigned_to, but by the email of that user (from `users.email where users.id = tickets.assigned_to`)
    - spe (from `tickets.c_spe`)
    - department (from `tickets.c_department`)

If the input id did not yield a ticket, returns an empty dict.

## Get all ticket comments into one big HTML string `get_comments`

### Inputs

- **`ticket`** (int) the ticket ID (`tickets.id`)

### Outputs

- **`dict`** of `{str : str}`
  A dictionary of comment thread info derived from database fields:
  - id: the ticket id, from `comments.ticket_id`
  - body: an HTML string of all the comments collated together, constructed from various fields in the `comments` table (see `make_html_comment` for formatting info)

If the ticket has no comments, *OR* doesn't exist, body will be ''

## Connection helper and wrapper `get_spiceworks`

### Inputs

- **`location`** (str|None)
  The path to the Spiceworks SQLite database file; if None, it will look for it in a config text file `SWlocation.txt`

### Outputs

- **`sqlite3.Connection`** object

## HTML comment thread helper `make_html_comment`

### Inputs

- **`row`** : tuple(\<int\>, \<int\>, \<string\>, \<string\>, \<string\>, \<string\>|None)
  The row data as extracted inside get_comments, containing:
  - id: the comment id (not used currently)
  - ticket_id: the id of the ticket this comment is for
  - body: the text of the comment
  - created_at: the timestamp of comment submission
  - email: the email of the comment author
  - attachment: the name of an attached file, if any, or None.

 ### Outputs

- **`str`**
  An HTML string with each comment in reverse submission order, with an H3 header for the author email and timestamp, the (roughly HTML-ified) body text, and the name of the attachment, if any.
  Note that threading of comments into a single HTML block is done by `get_comments`

  Example: 

        <h3><code>example_person@email.com</code> on 2022-01-01 10:00:00</h3><p>content of body..</p><p>Attachment: <em>myfile.jpg</em></p>
