The error is reported by the recipient domain\'s email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don\'t fix the problem, and you\'re the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:<br><br>The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.<br><br>Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient\'s email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.<br><br>Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren\'t behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.<br><br>Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient\'s email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).<br><br>Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.<br><br>For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972) .<br><br> |<br>Original Message Details |<br><br>Created Date: | 12/15/2022 2:02:16 PM |<br>Sender Address: | mpbit.uclh@nhs.net |<br>Recipient Address: | uclh.mpbit@nhs.net |<br>Subject: | [Ticket #3243] Login Issues persist for PBT physics Band 6 new hire |<br><br> |<br><br>Error Details |<br><br>Reported error: | 550 5.1.10 RESOLVER.ADR.RecipientNotFound; Recipient uclh.mpbit@nhs.net not found by SMTP address lookup  |<br>DSN generated by: | LO6P265MB7308.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM |<br><br> |<br><br>Message Hops |<br>HOP | TIME (UTC) | FROM | TO | WITH | RELAY TIME |<br>1 | 12/15/2022<br>2:02:16 PM | CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM | CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM | mapi | * |<br>2 | 12/15/2022<br>2:02:16 PM | CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM | LO6P265MB7308.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM | Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) | * |<br><br>Original Message Headers<br><br>Authentication-Results: dkim=none (message not signed)<br> header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=nhs.net;<br>Received: from CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM (2603:10a6:401:28::21)<br> by LO6P265MB7308.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM (2603:10a6:600:342::6) with<br> Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2,<br> cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.5924.12; Thu, 15 Dec<br> 2022 14:02:16 +0000<br>Received: from CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM<br> ([fe80::f66c:5dfa:907b:b66a]) by CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM<br> ([fe80::f66c:5dfa:907b:b66a%7]) with mapi id 15.20.5924.011; Thu, 15 Dec 2022<br> 14:02:16 +0000<br>Content-Type: multipart/mixed; name="winmail.dat"<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary<br>From: "UCLH, Mpbit (UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST)"<br>\t<mpbit.uclh@nhs.net><br>To: "uclh.mpbit@nhs.net" <uclh.mpbit@nhs.net><br>Subject: [Ticket #3243] Login Issues persist for PBT physics Band 6 new hire<br>Thread-Topic: [Ticket #3243] Login Issues persist for PBT physics Band 6 new<br> hire<br>Thread-Index: AQHZEI3WBK//eo0zNkyvmL9pwxjpAQ==<br>Date: Thu, 15 Dec 2022 14:02:16 +0000<br>Message-ID: <CWLP265MB14925E1A7B8526209ABE3C6C80E19@CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM><br>Accept-Language: en-US<br>Content-Language: en-US<br>X-MS-Has-Attach:<br>X-MS-TNEF-Correlator: <CWLP265MB14925E1A7B8526209ABE3C6C80E19@CWLP265MB1492.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM><br>MIME-Version: 1.0<br>X-MS-PublicTrafficType: Email<br>X-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: CWLP265MB1492:EE_|LO6P265MB7308:EE_<br>Return-Path: mpbit.uclh@nhs.net<br>X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 51c6f39e-7f89-4340-d130-08dadea4f975</p><hr><h3><code>david.taylor4@nhs.net</code> on 2022-12-15 14:02:10:</h3><p>Assigned to David Taylor.</p><hr><h3><code>microsoftexchange329e71ec88ae4615bbc36ab6ce41109e@nhs.onmicrosoft.com</code> on 2022-12-15 11:18:37:</h3><p>Attachment:</p><p><em>[Ticket #3243] Login Issues persist for PBT physics Band 6 new hire.eml</em></p><hr><h3><code>microsoftexchange329e71ec88ae4615bbc36ab6ce41109e@nhs.onmicrosoft.com</code> on 2022-12-15 11:18:37:</h3><p>Attachment:</p><p><em>image.png</em></p><hr><h3><code>microsoftexchange329e71ec88ae4615bbc36ab6ce41109e@nhs.onmicrosoft.com</code> on 2022-12-15 11:18:37:</h3><p>Attachment:</p><p><em>image.png</em></p><hr><h3><code>microsoftexchange329e71ec88ae4615bbc36ab6ce41109e@nhs.onmicrosoft.com</code> on 2022-12-15 11:18:37:</h3><p>|<br>Your message to uclh.mpbit@nhs.net couldn\'t be delivered.<br> |<br>uclh.mpbit wasn\'t found at nhs.net.<br> |<br><br>mpbit.uclh  | Office 365  | uclh.mpbit  |<br>Action Required  |  | Recipient  |<br><br> |  |  |  |  |<br><br> |<br>Unknown To address  |  |  |<br><br> |<br><br>How to Fix It |<br>The address may be misspelled or may not exist.
